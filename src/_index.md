Daniel's documentation for using [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org) for local servers on x86-64 and Raspberry Pi family. These documents use only the 'main' repository, except in one or more [optional HOWTO guides](howtos/_index.md). In addition, the documents try to keep things DRY (don't repeat yourself) in order to avoid out-of-sync information on the same topic.
