## Overview

While the LBU mechanism with backups allows restoring to previous state it lacks commented history. Done right, etckeeper will lead to a better record of what changes you made to the configuration and why, which improves your ability to recreate what you did, as well as understand why you did what you did. It also makes it easier to revert broken changes in a more granular fashion.

## Configure Git for the root user

This is known as a 'global' configuration as 'local' configuration refers to per-repository configuration.

The following command should be run as root (e.g. prefixed with `sudo` or doas  when in your admin non-root user account).

1. Make sure apk package list is up to date

   ```shell
   apk update
   ```

2. Add `git`

   ```shell
   apk add git
   ```

3. Execute the following commands as root, adjusted to suit you and your preferences

   ```shell
   git config --global init.defaultBranch main
   git config --global user.name "root@yourserver (Daniel F. Dickinson)" # Obviously you want your name here
   git config --global user.email "dfdpublic@wildtechgarden.ca" # Obviously you want your email here
   git config --global pull.ff only
   git config --global core.fileMode true
   git config --global core.eol lf
   git config --global core.autocrlf false
   git config --global core.editor nano
   ```

4. Repeat for your non-root admin user (*without* `sudo`), adjusted to suit your preferences. (Etckeeper uses the configured ``user.name`` and ``user.email`` of the original user (e.g. the ``sudo``-ing user for non-root admin `sudo`-ing to `root`) to set the author and committer fields, so you need to set at least `user.email` and `user.name` for each user that will be using `etckeeper`, even if through `sudo`).

## Install and configure etckeeper

1. Install etckeeper

    apk add etckeeper

2. Edit `/etc/etckeeper/etckeeper.conf` so it has the following snippets in place of the defaults for these items:

    1. Don't autocommit every day; this just creates noise if we are doing things right

       ``` shell
       AVOID_DAILY_AUTOCOMMITS=1
       ```

3. Just avoids a warning that doesn't help us much

   ``` shell
   AVOID_SPECIAL_FILE_WARNING=1
   ```

4. This will require to use ``etckeeper commit "A message about the commit"`` before installing with APK, if there are changes to `/etc` you have not already committed. This makes the logs more useful than the automatic messages that let one be too careless.

    ``` shell
    AVOID_COMMIT_BEFORE_INSTALL=1
    ```

5. Add root's ``.gitconfig`` to LBU backups

    ``` shell
    lbu add /root/.gitconfig
    ```

6. If your non-root admin user(s) home(s) are not on persistent storage, add those ``.gitconfig`` to LBU as well.

## Commit your changes

1. Commit changes to `etckeeper`

   ```shell
    etckeeper commit "Configure etckeeper"
   ```

2. Commit the changes to LBU (not strictly necessary if you will be doing other changes before committing; just *don't forget* to commit to LBU).

   ```shell
   lbu commit
   ```
