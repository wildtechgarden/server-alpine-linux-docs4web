## Steps

Screenshots are from GNOME but most GUI desktops are similar.

1. Select install tarball wherever you have it downloads (often in your `Downloads` directory), right-click and select 'Extract Toâ€¦'

2. Browse to the boot partition of the SD card

3. Select the boot partition of the SD card as extraction destination

4. The result will be a directory containing the boot files on the boot partition; we actually want the files in the top-level (root) of the boot partition.

5. Therefore, select all files in the directory that was created (e.g. in the file manager, browse into the directory and press \[Ctrl-A]).

6. Cut and paste the files into the top-level (root).

7. Remove the now extraneous extraction directory (which should be empty).
