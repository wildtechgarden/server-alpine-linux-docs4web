## Use Alpine Linux setup sub-scripts for network/DNS

1. Execute `setup-keymap` # To make sure you can successfully do keyboard input
2. Execute `setup-hostname`.
3. Execute `setup-interfaces`.
4. Execute `ifup eth0` # Or the appropriate interface for your system.
5. Execute `setup-dns` (if not using DHCP).

## Use Alpine Linux setup sub-script get setup network time

* Execute `setup-ntp` # If you don't setup NTP the time may be differ too much from internet hosts, resulting in failure attempting to use HTTPS, below.

## Use Alpine Linux setup sub-script to enable package repos

* Execute `setup-apkrepos`.

  You can use this as many times as you wish. Each time will append the repository you select in `/etc/apk/respositories`. This allows you to have multiple mirrors in your configuration, in case the default one is giving you trouble.

* Execute `apk update`.

* You are now ready to install the needed packages.
