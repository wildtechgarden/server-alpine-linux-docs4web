Add colour and context information to prompt.

## Overview

`/etc/profile` and the '`.sh`' scripts in `/etc/profile.d` are sourced on every invocation of the 'ash' (default Alpine/Busybox shell) as well as the 'bash' shell when launched as a login shell. This allows us to have some system-wide default configuration for these shells.

## Enable the disabled color_prompt.sh snippet

Execute:

``` shell
doas ln -sf /etc/profile.d/color_prompt.sh.disabled /etc/profile.d/color_prompt.sh
```

## Test it

1. Do a fresh login as any interactive shell  user (SSH logins work for this). **Do not** reboot before committing your changes.
2. Observe your fancy new colour prompt.

## Commit your changes

``` shell
doas lbu commit
```
