## Overview

This guide uses only tools included in the base configuration of Alpine Linux. It is only suitable for cases where your backups are small, or you have a very reliable network connection. If either of those is not the case you will need to look into `restic`, `borg` or other encrypted network backup tools.

## Case 1: Encrypted tarball via SSH

### Option 1: Pushed to some server
