# Alpine Linux as a Server

Daniel's documentation for using [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org) for local servers on x86-64 and Raspberry Pi family. It is a collection of documents in plain Markdown format that is intended for inclusion both on [Daniel's technical and professional website](https://www.wildtechgarden.ca/) as well as in [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org). In this case the hope is these docs will become part of the [Alpine Linux Docs](https://docs.alpinelinux.org/) or [Alpine Linux Wiki](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/) or some combination of those.
